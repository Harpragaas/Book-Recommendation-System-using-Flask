# Book-Recommendation-System-using-Flask

This project is an extension to the Book Recommendation System (https://github.com/Harpragaas/Book-Recommendation-System).

The above project uses the Flask web frame to generate the model in an application form.


### Files Details: 

1. data.pkl - This is the final dataset generated for the application. Here, I have used a pickle file instead of a csv, to get the complete data and not missing out on any information.

2. app.py - This is the main Flask file used to create the application.
